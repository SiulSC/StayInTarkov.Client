## HOW TO FIX CUSTOM BUNDLES NOT APPEARING OR APPEARING AS DOGES:
---

The issue happens when the bundle is not organized as it should be, or has a different file extension like .GOBLIN

You will need the original mod from the SPT Hub or Nexus with the bundles folder and the files in it.

## To fix this, you need to follow some steps:

1. Go to your game and find /user/cache/bundles
2. Go into the bundles folder, and here is where the magic happens
3. Now go to your desired mod you wanna fix and go into the bundles folder inside that mod
4. Select all the files inside the bundles folder in your desired mod
5. Copy all of the files from the bundles folder in your desired mod
6. Paste the files inside the /user/cache/bundles folder you opened in Step 2.
7. After you paste the files, it will tell you if you want to replace them and click replace
8. Done! Your mod should work properly and you can bundle your cache folder into a modpack to send it to your friends so they also get the fix.
